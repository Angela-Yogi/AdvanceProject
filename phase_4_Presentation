# Phase 4 – Project Presentation    

## 🎯 Project title

**LearningOnlinePlatform** – A full-stack educational web application for exploring and managing online courses.

---

## 📝 Project overview

**LearningOnlinePlatform** is designed for users who want to register, log in, and explore available courses. The platform is ideal for educational institutions or individuals wanting to create a course listing system. It includes core user authentication features and course browsing.

## 📌 Use case summary

| Use Case | Implemented (Yes/No) | Demonstration / Notes |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| User registration | Yes | Implemented with React form and backend API integration. |
| User login | Yes | Validates user credentials with backend. |
| Browse courses | Yes | Courses fetched from backend and rendered on frontend. |
| Enroll in courses | No | Could be added by linking user-course relationship in database. |
| Admin course management | No | Planned as a future feature for adding/editing courses. |

## ✍️ Technical implementation

- **Frontend**: React + Vite
  - Pages: `Home`, `Courses`, `Login`, `Register`
  - State management with React Hooks
  - REST API calls via `fetch`
  - Custom CSS styling

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
  - Endpoints:
    - `POST /api/auth/register`
    - `POST /api/auth/login`
    - `GET /api/courses`
  - Uses **SQLite** via `sqlite3`
  - Basic error handling implemented

- **Authentication**:
  - Passwords stored in plaintext (for MVP simplicity)
  - No JWT/session yet — could be added in future

- **Deployment (Dev)**:
  - Frontend: Vite dev server (port 5173)
  - Backend: Express server (port 3000)

## 🚂 Development process

- Started with backend and database structure (SQLite + Express)
- Built API routes for authentication and courses
- Created frontend views and handled state with React Hooks
- Faced challenges:
  - CORS issues between frontend/backend
  - Git merge conflicts during push
  - Simplifying password handling for login testing

- Key decisions:
  - Prioritized basic authentication and course display
  - Left admin and enrollment for future expansion

---

## ☀️ Reflection and future work

### ✅ What worked well:
- Clean separation of backend and frontend
- Successful API integration
- Simple and readable code structure

### 🚧 Challenges:
- Git conflicts and pushing to a repo with existing content
- No hashed passwords for now
- Course enrollment was more complex than expected

### 💡 Future improvements:
- Implement password hashing with `bcrypt`
- Add course enrollment feature
- Create admin dashboard for managing courses
- Add JWT-based login session or use cookies for security
